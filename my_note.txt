useEffect Hook:
        It us used to perform some effect in your component.
        It is very useful specially if you want to fetch an API


        it run every re-render,
        // that mean every state change, it will re-render
                useEffect(() => {
                        fetch()...
                })



        we can control it:
        second paramenter can also accept an array
        it call dependancy.
        // if we pass empty array as an argument, it will run only one.(at the first re-render, of the component)
                useEffect(() => {
                        fetch()...
                },[])
        
        and if we pass any state variable or dependancy,
        then, it will only run, if the dependancy or state variable changes.
