useReducer Hook:

        const {state, dispatch} = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

        const reducer((state, action) => {
                return state;
        })

        explain:
        useReducer took 2 argument:
                reduce function
                initialState
        and it gives us
                state variable and
                dispatch function
        
        works:
        first of all
        state variable hold 
           initial data from initialState

        and reduce method will take the current state and action parameter, 
                then return new state

        finally dispatch method use to update the state variable.
